# CENG 241 â€” Lab Exercises 1

## Overview
This program defines a single structure that represents the storeâ€™s **dynamic stock list**.  
It holds a **1-dimensional dynamic array** for storing product stock quantities, along with two numbers â€” **size** and **capacity** â€” that describe how much of the array is used and how much memory is available.

### Structure Fields
- **int *data;** â€” Pointer to a 1D dynamic integer array storing stock quantities.  
  Each element represents the number of units available for a specific product.

- **int size;** â€” Current number of products (number of elements actually used).

- **int capacity;** â€” Total number of elements the array can hold before more memory must be allocated.

Together, these fields enable the program to store, expand, and manage product stock dynamically during execution.

## Functions to Implement

### 1. `create`
- Initializes an empty inventory with a given initial capacity.  
- Receives: initial capacity and a reference to the inventory.  
- Returns: success/failure.  
- Allocates memory and sets `size = 0` so the array is ready to store stock counts.

### 2. `destroy`
- Safely closes the inventory.  
- Receives: a reference to the inventory.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Frees all allocated memory and nulls pointers to prevent memory leaks.

### 3. `reserve`
- Pre-allocates shelf space for more products.  
- Receives: new capacity and the inventory.  
- Returns: success/failure.  
- Uses reallocation to increase capacity without altering the current product count.

### 4. `append`
- Adds a new productâ€™s stock count at the end.  
- Receives: inventory and integer stock quantity.  
- Returns: success/failure.  
- Grows capacity automatically if needed and increments product count.

### 5. `insert_at`
- Inserts a new product at a specific position.  
- Receives: inventory, target index, and stock quantity.  
- Returns: success/failure.  
- Shifts later items to the right to maintain order and increases size by one.

### 6. `delete_at`
- Removes a product from a given position.  
- Receives: inventory and index.  
- Returns: success/failure.  
- Shifts remaining items left and decreases size.

### 7. `find`
- Locates the first product whose stock equals a target value.  
- Receives: inventory and target integer.  
- Returns: index of first match or `-1` if not found.  
- Performs a linear search.

### 8. `print`
- Shows a snapshot of the inventory.  
- Receives: inventory.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Prints stock quantities, current size, and capacity.

### 9. `sort_asc`
- Orders products from lowest to highest stock.  
- Receives: inventory.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Sorts the array to highlight low-stock items for replenishment.

### 10. `reverse`
- Flips the order of products.  
- Receives: inventory.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Performs an in-place reversal to get a high-to-low view after sorting.

### 11. `stats`
- Computes quick KPIs over stock levels.  
- Receives: inventory and output holders for min, max, and average.  
- Returns: success/failure (fails if empty).  
- Reports the lowest, highest, and mean stock.

### 12. `show_size_capacity`
- Reports inventory health.  
- Receives: inventory.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Prints the number of products tracked and total capacity.

### 13. `print_menu`
- Displays the operator menu.  
- Receives: nothing.  
- Returns: nothing.  
- Lists available actions for the menu-driven interface.
