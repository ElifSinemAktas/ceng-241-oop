# CENG 241 – Week 1 – Lab 1

## Task 1: Four Operations with Dynamic Array, Pointers, and Functions

**Description:**
- The program will use a dynamic array to store two numbers entered by the user.  
- Pointers and functions will be used to perform the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- Each operation will be handled by a separate function that takes pointers as parameters.  
- The results will be displayed to the user.  
- Proper memory management (using `delete`) will be implemented.

## Task 2: Stationery Stock Management with Dynamic 2D Array

**Description:**
- The program will manage stock for 10 stationery stores.  
- Each store has 5 different items.  
- A dynamic 2D array will be created using pointers (`int**`).  
- The program will provide a menu with options:  
  1. Show stock of a store.  
  2. Add stock for a specific item in a store.  
  3. Reduce stock for a specific item in a store.  
  4. Exit program.  
- Input validation will be performed for store and item numbers.  
- Proper memory deallocation will be done when exiting the program.
